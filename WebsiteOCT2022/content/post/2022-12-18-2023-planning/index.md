# Next Year Plan


> _"A goal without a plan is just a wish."_ 
> 
> Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

**My 2023 goal is to improve my employability, my altruism capability, and my life quality.**

For reaching this goal, in this year change I will start an experiment, I will put my self-development plan in this post and I will compare it at the end of the next year.

Reviewing this year, I checked that I made several self-improvements as advancing with my Ph.D., Modelling and thesis writing, starting this blog, improving my coding, and communications skills, connecting with a lot of interesting people, and so.

But, this post is about thinking in the future, considering:

- Thesis Development;
- Self-development courses;
- Content creation.

And the most important thing:
